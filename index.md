[Note: This site is not an official Software Carpentry lesson. The lesson is under development for use in the Doane Digital Imaging and Vision Applications in Science (DIVAS) Image Processing summer workshop.]

This lesson shows some basics to get you started with the Python programming language.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Before beginning these lessons, you should have either the DIVAS virtual machine OR Python and a Python IDE installed on your 
> computer (see the Setup page).  The lessons will show you how to start the Spyder IDE within the DIVAS virtual machine.  If you 
> do not have the DIVAS virtual machine installed, any Python IDE will work. These example code and outputs shown in the lessons 
> refer to Python 3.

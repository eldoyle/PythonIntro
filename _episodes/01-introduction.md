The ability to write your own computer code to analyze data is a great skill for any scientist to have!  By taking the time to 
write few lines of code, you can analyze experimental data, organize your files, automate repetitive number-crunching tasks, and 
create workflows that will be transparent, reproducible, and easily shared with colleagues and collaborators.

The goal of these workshops is to help you get your coding "feet" wet, by learning some basic Python programming skills.  Then, 
you'll move on to apply those skills to real image data sets.

## Why Python?

Python is a programming language that is commonly used in the natural sciences to create workflows and analyze data. Although you 
should use whatever programming language makes sense for your work, Python has several advantages:
1. Python is an open-source language that is freely available
2. Python runs on almost all computing platforms and environments
3. Python has a growing base of scientific users!  There are numerous online resources and examples available
4. Python is relatively easy for new users to learn
5. Python has a variety of tools available for image processing and computer vision, including the [OpenCV]( https://docs.opencv.org/) library.

> ## Learn the language that makes the most sense for you! 
> Although Python is commonly used in the natural sciences, different communities of scientists may have a different "preferred" 
> programming language.  You should learn and use the language that is common in your community, so that will be easier to share
> and collaborate on code with your colleagues.
> 
> Fortunately, the basic concepts and ideas you are learning in Python will also be present in another programming language!  
> Once you've learned one, picking up another language will be much easier.

## The examples
The best way to learn Python is to read, write, and experiment with Python code that solves real problems!  To help you do this,
we will focus on two image-based examples.

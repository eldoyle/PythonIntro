> ## Variable Switching
>
> Given the following two variables
> ~~~
> density1 = 4.59
> density2 = 3.28
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}

> write code to “switch” the values so that the final result is that
> ~~~
> density1 = 3.28
> density2 = 4.59
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > The trick here is to create a temporary variable so that the values stored are not "lost"
> >
> > ~~~
> > temp1 = density1
> > density1 = density2
> > density2 = temp1
> > print(density1, density2)
> > ~~~

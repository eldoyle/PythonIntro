Conditionals are another powerful tool to use in our computer programs: they allow the program to make choices and run part of the code only if a specific condition or conditions are met

*We use the Syntax*
**if <condition>:
	do this if condition 1 is true
else:
		do this if the condition is not true
		
this is not part of the if/else block and will always be executed**

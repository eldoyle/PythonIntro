## Numbers and strings let us store 1 piece of data in a single variable.  However, it is often useful to store multiple pieces of data in a single variable.  For example, image we have root areas for 4 different roots.  Instead of making 4 different variables, we can use a list to keep them all together.  This is also handy because we only have to keep track of one variable name! 

## Lists are created using square brackets, with the items separated by commas

## Creating a list (populated or empty)
~~~
areas = [6929.6, 8536.47, 11359.3, 17743.4]
print('Areas are:', areas)

We can also make lists of strings, or even lists of lists!
~~~
samples = ['Trial16', 'Trial20', 'Trial293']
print('Sample names are:', samples)
~~~
{: .language-python}

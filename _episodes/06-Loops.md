## Making the computer repeat things

This is where being able to write your own code gets really powerful!  Often, we will need to repeat the same calculation over and over, or repeat the same analysis workflow on multiple different files.  Loops are one tool that allows us to repeat things.

Note: Because properly using loops requires careful attention to spacing and indentation, will work primarily from scripts.

~~~
#One way to print every letter in a word
word = 'lead'

print(word[0])
print(word[1])
print(word[2])
print(word[3])
~~~
{: .language-python}

However, this is a very inefficient approach!  If the word gets much longer, then we are better off typing out the letters ourselves.  Or what if we donâ€™t know how long the word is?

~~~
#A much better way to print every letter in the word
word2 = 'oxygen'
for letter in word2:
	print("The letter is " + letter)
    
print('Done with the for loop')
~~~
{: .language-python}

This approach is much more efficient:  We only have type a few lines of code and it is scalable- we could use the same code for any word of any length.
